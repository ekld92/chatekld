"""Opt-in LLM ``.tex`` integrity review + auto-repair (advisory, gated).

This is the *prompt/parse/screen* core of the Deck Generator's final-stage
integrity pass. Like the rest of the deckgen core (``assemble.py`` /
``scaffold.py``) it is **app-independent and free of any LLM/transport import**:
the actual model call lives in ``api/routes/deck.py`` (the one place deckgen is
allowed to reach into ``core.llm``, alongside ``inprocess.py``'s reach into
``core.agent``), so this module stays hermetically unit-testable with no live
provider.

The pass is deliberately a *smarter heuristic*, not a compiler (the subsystem is
emit-only by design — see ``assemble.py``): the model is shown the fully
assembled deck and asked to flag the structural problems that would stop it
compiling and, when it can, return a **repaired** copy of the whole document.
Two guards keep the repair safe to offer:

* :func:`screen_repair` re-validates the proposed document and **refuses** any
  repair that introduces a dangerous compile-time macro (``\\write18`` /
  ``\\input`` / …) the original did not contain, or that loses the single
  ``document`` environment / all frames — so a prompt-injected vault note cannot
  smuggle a shell-escape in through the "repair", and a wholesale-rewrite that
  breaks the deck worse than the original is dropped rather than written;
* the repaired document is only ever *offered* — the route writes the original
  deck to disk and surfaces the repair behind a per-action confirm (``POST
  /api/deck/apply-repair``), mirroring Note Refactor's preview-then-apply.

Imports flow deckgen-review → deckgen.assemble only (same package, pure).
